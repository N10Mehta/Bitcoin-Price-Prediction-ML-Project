The Bitcoin Price Prediction project aims to forecast the future price of Bitcoin using machine learning algorithms and historical market data. By analyzing various factors that influence Bitcoin's price movements, this project provides insights and predictions that can assist investors and traders in making informed decisions.

#Features
i.ata Collection: Gather historical Bitcoin price data from various sources, including APIs and CSV files.
ii.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to visualize trends, patterns, and correlations in the Bitcoin market.
iii.Predictive Modeling: Implement machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM to predict Bitcoin prices.
iv.Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared.
v.Visualization: Generate plots to visualize historical prices and predicted future trends.

#Dataset
The project uses a dataset containing the following columns:
Date: The date of the recorded price.
Open: The opening price of Bitcoin on that date.
High: The highest price of Bitcoin during that day.
Low: The lowest price of Bitcoin during that day.
Close: The closing price of Bitcoin on that date.
Volume: The trading volume of Bitcoin for that day.
